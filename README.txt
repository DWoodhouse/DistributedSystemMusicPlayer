Here is how to make it play a song:

1. Find a music file to play. IMPORTANT must be .wav filetype (.wav files are much larger than mp3)
Links to the examples used within the program are here:

domslittlewebsite.com/bensound-summer.wav
domslittlewebsite.com/UnknownBrain-Superhero.wav
domslittlewebsite.com/Disfigure-Blank.wav


2. On the server (FileSelector.java) there is a two-dimensional array which is where the song name and filepath is stored

3. Run the server and client seperately at same time (I typically run them within IntelliJ)

4. Login on client side with username = admin and password = 123

5. Follow instructions on command line to play song
