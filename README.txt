Here is how to make it play a song:

1. Find a music file to play. IMPORTANT must be .wav filetype (.wav files are much larger than mp3)
Links to the examples used within the program can be downloaded here:

domslittlewebsite.com/extrafiles/UnknownBrain-Superhero.wav
domslittlewebsite.com/extrafiles/Disfigure-Blank.wav

2. On the server (FileSelector.java) there is a two-dimensional array which is where the song name and filepath is stored. Ensure the filepath is correct to where it is stored on your computer

3. Run the server and client seperately at same time (I typically run them within IntelliJ)

4. Login on client side with username = admin and password = 123

5. Follow command line prompts to play song
